This project is no longer being worked on. I will leave it up for a while so people that might wanna copy can still download it.

This is my fork of Secrets of Sosaria called Tribulations of Power.<br>
I  have added the following things from Ultima Adventures<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; - The Combat Bar. It shows you a lot of usefull information.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&ensp; Use the command [combatbar to bring it up. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- I have added 2 of there Special Classes, The Troubadour and The Sorcerer.
<br>
<br>
My personal additions so far are the following.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- The Barbarian Special Class. Unleash your inner SMASH!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- The Barbarian Helm. It is a special Helm that can only be used when <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&ensp;the Barbarian Special Class is active. It can be enhaced, but the<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&ensp;amount of enhancement points are determined by your Tactics and Anatomy skill.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- I plan to add a special Barbarian Loin cloth and Custom Barbarian abilities.<br>

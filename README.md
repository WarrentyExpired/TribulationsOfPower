This is my fork of Secrets of Sosaria called Tribulations of Power.
I  have added the following things from Ultima Adventures
	- The Combat Bar. It shows you a lot of usefull information.
	  Use the command [combatbar to bring it up.
	- I have added 2 of there Special Classes, The Troubadour and The Sorcerer.

My personal additions so far are the following.
	- The Barbarian Special Class. Unleash your inner SMASH!
	- The Barbarian Helm. It is a special Helm that can only be used when 
	  the Barbarian Special Class is active. It can be enhaced, but the 
	  amount of enhancement points are determined by your Tactics and Anatomy skill.
	- I plan to add a special Barbarian Loin cloth and Custom Barbarian abilities.
